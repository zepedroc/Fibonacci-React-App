# Sync_VR_React_App

ReactJS app that connects with Fibonacci API.

## ReactJS

Used ReactJS because of it's improved performance compared to it's peers and because 
code can be implemented in components, which allows for more reusability, readability and scaling.

## TypeScript

TypeScript code is more reliable and easier to refactor than vanilla Javascript.

## Styling

Used a different file for each Component for more readability.
