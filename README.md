App running on https://dazzling-cajeta-27b8d9.netlify.app/

App hosted on Netlify because of its free services and good recomendations online.

## ReactJS

Used ReactJS because of it's improved performance compared to it's peers and because 
code can be implemented in components, which allows for more reusability, readability and scaling.

## TypeScript

TypeScript code is more reliable and easier to refactor than vanilla Javascript.

## Styling

Used a different file for each Component for more readability.
